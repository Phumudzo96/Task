# Task

Create a simple calculator application that asks a user to enter two
numbers and the operation (e.g. +, -, x, etc.) that they’d like to perform on
the numbers. Display the answer to the equation. Every equation entered
by the user should be written to a text ﬁle. Use defensive programming to
write this program in a manner that is robust and handles unexpected
events and user inputs.

Now extend your program to give the user the option to either enter two
numbers and an operator, like before, or to read all of the equations f rom
a new txt ﬁle (the user should add the name of the txt ﬁle as an input) and
print out all of the equations together with the results. Use defensive
programming to ensure that the program does not crash if the ﬁle does
not exist and that the user is prompted again to enter the name of the ﬁle.
